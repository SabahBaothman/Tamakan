A website that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze spoken explanations of scientific content. Users explain concepts by voice, and the NLP-powered AI compares the explanation to provided slides, assigning a score based on accuracy and clarity. The system also gives detailed feedback on how to improve the explanation, providing both evaluative and documentary comments. The platform integrates exams to further assess user understanding and progress.
